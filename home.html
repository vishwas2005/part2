                Bentley Motors Limited is a British designer, manufacturer and marketer of luxury cars and SUVs.
                Headquartered in Crewe, England, the company was founded by W. O. Bentley (1888–1971)
                in 1919 in Cricklewood, North London, and became widely known for winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in
                1924, 1927, 1928, 1929 and 1930.
                Bentley has been a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group since 1998 and consolidated under VW's premium
                brand arm Audi since 2022.
                Prominent models extend from the historic sports-racing Bentley 4½ Litre and Bentley Speed Six; the more
                recent Bentley R Type Continental, Bentley Turbo R, and Bentley Arnage; to its current model line,
                including the Flying Spur, Continental GT, Bentayga and the Mulsanne—which are marketed worldwide, with
                China as its largest market as of November 2012.[17]
                Today most Bentley models are assembled at the company's Crewe factory, with a small number assembled at
                Volkswagen's Dresden factory, Germany,[18] and with bodies for the Continental manufactured in Zwickau
                and for the Bentayga manufactured at the Volkswagen Bratislava Plant.
                The joining and eventual separation of Bentley and Rolls-Royce followed a series of mergers and
                acquisitions, beginning with the 1931 purchase by Rolls-Royce of Bentley, then in receivership. In 1971,
                Rolls-Royce itself was forced into receivership and the UK government nationalised the company—splitting
                it into an aerospace company (Rolls-Royce Plc) and an automotive company (Rolls-Royce Motors Limited,
                including Bentley).
                Rolls-Royce Motors was subsequently sold to engineering conglomerate Vickers, and in 1998 Vickers sold
                Rolls-Royce to Volkswagen AG, including Bentley with its name and logos (but not the name "Rolls
                Royce").
